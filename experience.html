                        <p>During my internship at Kestrix, I developed a 3D viewing component using JavaScript, React, GraphQL, and Three.js, 
                            rewriting and optimizing it in React to meet modern standards and enhance performance. I successfully delivered the project ahead of schedule, 
                            exceeding expectations for quality and maintainability. Working cross-functionally, I collaborated with teams to integrate the component into the company’s core workflow, 
                            improving UI/UX and ensuring seamless compatibility with existing systems. Through this work, I contributed to a mission-critical tool in Kestrix’s pipeline that
                             significantly improved both user experience and operational efficiency.

                        <p>
                            As a teaching assistant, I graded student work according to a specified rubric for upper-level mathematics classes.
                             In addition, I proctored exams under the supervision of a professor.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a tutor, I worked with college students in developmental mathematics classes to improve their basic reasoning/algebraic skills.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a Web Editor, I conducted weekly maintenance of the student-run paper’s website, posting content, designing pages, and manipulating the back-end classification system to create a more maintainable environment.
