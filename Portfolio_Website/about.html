                        Student with Senior class standing at the Paul Allen School for Computer Science and
                        Engineering at the University of Washington, with a heavy focus on front-end engineering, secure systems,
                        and scientific computing. Expected to graduate in June 2027 with a B.S in Computer Engineering and
                        a minor in Applied Mathematics.

                        With skills in React, React Native, JavaScript/Typescript, HTML/CSS, Python/Flask, Java, and SQL, I 
                        am passionate about building scalable and accessible front-end systems that have global impact and keep users 
                        in mind. In the summer of 2025, I interned with Kestrix as a Front-End Engineer, where I developed a mission critical
                        front end 3d-visualization component that increased efficiency in their Thermal-Modeling pipeline.

                        At my university, I am an active member of Husky Coding Project (one of the largest student-run tech organizations
                        on campus), where I work as a project manager for multiple projects leading teams of engineers to deliver usable
                        software to improve student life.
